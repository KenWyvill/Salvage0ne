Well, I just received my first 3D printer! A Creality K1Max 300mm x 300mm x 300mm printer. The capablities are incredible, and the quality of the prints are amazing to say the very least.
I am quite new to Github, so I'm not sure what to put in the ReadMe file, but for all intents and purposes, this is for the rooting of my machine and probably my print jobs will go here. We'll see
as I get better at using this. :)
